          Deep in the blue water of the ocean lived a tuna fish named Tino. He was small compared to the 
          other tunas in his school, but his heart was full of courage. 
          Every day, the tunas swam togather, darting through waves and chasing tiny silver fish.
          But Tino spotted a shiny object dreamed of seeing what Iay beyond the reef, shadows.
          One morning, while the was feeding, 
          From that day on, Tino was no longer the samll tuna. He was the brave little fish who proved that courage and curiosity could unlock great things even, endless sea.
