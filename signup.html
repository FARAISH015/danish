Once upon a time, in a quiet forest, there lived a little brid named Piko. Piko was a small, but he was full of dreams. While the other birds stayed close to the trees, Piko would sit on the highest branch and stare at the big, blue sky.
One day, a strom come. The wind howled, rain poured, and lightning struck a gaint tree. Many animals were afraid, hiding in their burrows. But Piko looked at the sky and thought,"if I stay here, i may never see what lies beyond. Maybe it's time to be  brave"
When the strom clamed down, the little brid flapped his wings and brgan to fly --- higher and father than ever brfore. He crossed rivers, hills and even mountains. Along the way, he saw beautiful lands, helped other brids find food, and learned many new songs.
When he finally returned home, everyone gathered around him. "Weren't you scared?" asked an old owl.
Piko smiled and said, 
"yes I was scared. But if I never tried, I would never have known how high I could fly. "
From that day on, the animals of the forest remembered: courage isn't about not being afraid --- it's about flying anyway. 

THE LOST STAR
Once upon a time, in a quiet little village, there lived a young gril named Aria who loved watching the night sky.
One evening, while lying on the grass, she noticed a bright star fall from thr sky and land somewhere beyond the hills.
Curious and brave, Aria decided to find the star. She packed some bread, a lantern, and set off on her adventure.
On her way, she met: A talking fox who guided her thought the dark forest. 
A grumpy old owl who tested her with a riddle to let her pass.
A river of glass she had to cross by solving the secret of the moon's reflection. 
Finally, she reached a glowing carter where the fallen star lay. But the star was craying --- it wanted to go back home. Aria promised to help.
Together, they climed the tallest mountain. Aria whispered her wish to the wind, and the wind carried the star back into the sky, where it sparkled even brighter than before.
When she returned to her village, everyone thought it was just a dream -- but every night, the brightest star winked at her from the sky.
