Once upon a time, in a quiet forest, there lived a little brid named Piko. Piko was a small, but he was full of dreams. While the other birds stayed close to the trees, Piko would sit on the highest branch and stare at the big, blue sky.
One day, a strom come. The wind howled, rain poured, and lightning struck a gaint tree. Many animals were afraid, hiding in their burrows. But Piko looked at the sky and thought,"if I stay here, i may never see what lies beyond. Maybe it's time to be  brave"
When the strom clamed down, the little brid flapped his wings and brgan to fly --- higher and father than ever brfore. He crossed rivers, hills and even mountains. Along the way, he saw beautiful lands, helped other brids find food, and learned many new songs.
When he finally returned home, everyone gathered around him. "Weren't you scared?" asked an old owl.
Piko smiled and said, 
"yes I was scared. But if I never tried, I would never have known how high I could fly. "
From that day on, the animals of the forest remembered: courage isn't about not being afraid --- it's about flying anyway.
